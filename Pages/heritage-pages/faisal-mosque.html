            The Faisal Mosque is the largest mosque in Pakistan, located in the
            national capital city of Islamabad. Completed in 1986, it was
            designed by Turkish architect Vedat Dalokay, shaped like a desert
            Bedouin's tent, is an iconic symbol of Islamabad throughout the
            world. It is situated at the north end of Faisal Avenue, putting it
            at the northernmost end of the city and at the foot of Margalla
            Hills, the westernmost foothills of the Himalayas. It is located on
            an elevated area of land against a picturesque backdrop of the
            Margalla Hills. This enviable location represents the mosque's great
            importance and allows it to be seen from miles around day and night.
            The Faisal Mosque was conceived as the National Mosque of Pakistan
            and named after the late King Faisal bin Abdul-Aziz of Saudi Arabia,
            who supported and financed the project. The largest mosque in
            Pakistan, the Faisal Mosque was the largest mosque in the world from
            1986 until 1993, when it was overtaken in size by the newly
            completed Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca, Morocco. Subsequent
            expansions of the Masjid al-Haram (Grand Mosque) of Mecca and the
            Al-Masjid al-Nabawi (Prophet's Mosque) in Medina, Saudi Arabia,
            during the 1990s relegated Faisal Mosque to fourth place in terms of
            size.
            <H1> Exterior Architecture</H1>
            <h2> Main Building</h2>
            Instead of using traditional domes, Vedat Dalokay (architect of the Shah Faisal Masjid) designed an eight-sided main hall that looked like an Arab's Bedouin desert tent. Additionally, he added four minarets on all four corners of the main hall, which are of 80 m (260 ft) high, the tallest minarets in South Asia.
            <H2> Prayer Hall</H2>
            The main structure of the building is the main prayer hall, which is supported by four concrete girders. The interior of the main tent-shaped hall is covered in white marble and decorated with mosaics and calligraphy by the famous Pakistani artist Sadequain, and a spectacular Turkish-style chandelier. The mosaic pattern adorns the west wall and has the Kalimah written in early Kufic script, repeated in mirror image pattern.
