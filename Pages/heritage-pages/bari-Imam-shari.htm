<h2> History of Shrine Imam Bari Sarkar</h2>H
Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb built the shrine in the 17th century, and it was later renovated during British rule. Since then, the shrine has undergone several renovations, including a recent one by the Government of Pakistan. As a result of these renovations, the shrine now offers more space to accommodate a more significant number of people. It has separate entrances for male and female devotees.

The shrine is similar to other shrines in Pakistan and South Asia, providing visitors with a similar atmosphere and activities. It is a magnificent complex with various buildings, courtyards, and gardens. The shrine’s main building is adorned with beautiful Islamic calligraphy and intricate tilework, housing the tomb of Bari Imam.
