            Rohtas Fort, built in the 16th century at a strategic site in the
            north of Pakistan, Province of Punjab, is an exceptional example of
            early Muslim military architecture in central and south Asia. The
            main fortifications of this 70-hectare garrison consist of massive
            masonry walls more than four kilometres in circumference, lined with
            68 bastions and pierced at strategic points by 12 monumental
            gateways. A blend of architectural and artistic traditions from
            elsewhere in the Islamic world, the fort had a profound influence on
            the development of architectural style in the Mughal Empire. Sher
            Sha Suri, founder of the Suri dynasty, commenced construction of
            Rohtas Fort (also called Qila Rohtas) in 1541. Irregular in plan,
            this early example of Muslim military architecture follows the
            contours of its hilltop site. An interior wall partitions the inner
            citadel from the remainder of the fort, and an internal water supply
            in the form of baolis (stepped wells) gave the fortâ€™s garrison
            self-sufficiency in water. <br>
            A beautiful mosque known as Shahi Masjid
            is situated near the Kabuli Gate, and the Haveli (Palatial House)
            Man Singh was constructed later in the Mughal period. Rohtas Fort
            represented a new form of fortification, based essentially on
            Turkish military architecture developed in reaction to the
            introduction of gunpowder and cannon, but transformed into a
            distinct style of its own. Rohtas Fort blended architectural and
            artistic traditions from Turkey and the Indian subcontinent, thereby
            creating the model for Mughal architecture and its subsequent
            refinements and adaptations (including the European colonial
            architecture that made abundant use of that tradition). Most
            noteworthy are the sophistication and high artistic value of its
            decorative elements, notably its high- and low-relief carvings, its
            calligraphic inscriptions in marble and sandstone, its plaster
            decoration, and its glazed tiles.
