            The national monument in Islamabad has two distinct sections: the
            main monument and the museum. The giant flower-like structure is
            made of granite and situated on an elevated platform. It comprises
            four large petals representing the four provinces – Punjab, Sindh,
            Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. These big petals are accompanied
            by three smaller petals. <br />
            These represent Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Gilgit Baltistan and the
            Federally Administered Tribal Areas, which used to be a
            semi-autonomous tribal region until 2018. Meanwhile, some incredible
            artwork occupies the inner walls of these petals. These murals
            illustrate the story of the independence of Pakistan along with
            celebrating the important landmarks across the country. A team of
            artists led by Zarar Haider Babri and Kausar Jahan spent some
            119,000 hours creating these majestic murals. The stunning murals on
            the first petal of the national monument in Islamabad reflect the
            beautiful Faisal Mosque, Makli Necropolis in Sindh, Rohtas Fort near
            Jhelum, Shah Jahan Mosque in Thatta and the port city of Gawadar.
            Meanwhile, the art of the second petal features images of
            Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah and Fatima Jinnah. It also
            illustrates the historic Badshahi Mosque and Minar-e-Pakistan in
            Lahore, Karakorum Highway in the northern area of Pakistan and a
            crowd watching Quaid-e-Azam’s speech. The artwork on the third petal
            includes the images of National Poet on Pakistan Allama Iqbal, Tomb
            of Shah Rukn-e-Alam in Multan, the famous Mahabat Khan Mosque in
            Peshawar, Indus River Delta and the magnificent Lahore Fort.
            Furthermore, the last petal shows sketches of the tombs in Uch
            Sharif, Islamia College Peshawar, Quaid-e-Azam Residency in Ziarat,
            Shalimar Bagh in Lahore and the Khyber Pass, to name a few. Along
            with a large fountain in the middle of these granite petals, the
            Pakistan Monument in Islamabad also includes four pillars. These
            structures display the words ‘Faith,’ ‘Unity’ and ‘Discipline’ both
            in Urdu and English. There is also a wall with hand impressions of
            every designer, architect, engineer and labour who helped with the
            construction.
            <br />Right next to the main monument is a circular terrace with
            beautiful archways that serves as a viewpoint. You can pretty much
            see the entire city from this place – including the metallic
            crescent on Shakarparian Hills that has been inscribed with the
            quotes of Quaid-e-Azam and poetry of Allama Iqbal. The location of
            Pakistan Monument and the lush green gardens surrounding it also
            make it one of the most beautiful tourist attractions in the federal
            capital. The Pakistan Monument Museum is also known as Islamabad
            Museum. It is located across from the Pakistan Monument. The museum
            features beautiful paintings, life-like wax statues, grand exhibits
            and historical pictures. These mural illustrate major events that
            led to the creation of Pakistan. From the advent of Islam in the
            region to the splendours of the Mughal era and from the War of
            Independence to the Pakistan Movement, this incredible museum makes
            these past events come back to life. That’s not it. The museum in
            Islamabad also houses an impressive reference library along with an
            Audio Visual Center. This is where you can find archives of
            historical speeches and other national records. There is also a
            conference hall and an auditorium known as Panorama Hall. It has a
            seating capacity of 62 people.
