            Saidpur is one of the oldest villages of Pakistan. It is more than
            five hundred years old village known for its rich heritage, culture,
            history and folklore. The village mentioned in Tuzk-e-Jahangiri as a
            place beyond Rawalpindi has a unique attraction in its serene
            environment; anyone who passes by it falls in love with it.
            Jahangir, thus, married the owner of the village the daughter of
            Said Khan. After witnessing the majestic beauty of Saidpur village,
            without any hesitation, Jahangir would be called the son-in-law of
            Islamabad (capital of Pakistan). There is completely a different
            experience to visit Saidpur in the day light and in the calm
            evenings. One can feel the difference of two different times by
            looking at the surroundings. During day time, especially in
            holidays, the place is packed with people while in the evening; the
            place narrates its own tales of different eras. Both summer and
            winter has its own charm in the village. According to the history,
            in 1530 AD, Mirza Fateh Ali founded the village. Initially, it came
            to be known after him as Fatehpur Baoli. However, later, when the
            area was given to Said Khan Gakhar by the Mughal Emperor Akbar for
            his family s services in the fight against Afghan warrior Sher Shah
            Suri, the name of the village changed from Fatehpur to Saidpur. The
            village was named Saidpur after Sultan Said Khan; son of Sultan
            Sarang Khan during the rule of Mughal Emperor Babar Sultan Sarang
            Khan was the Lord of Pothohar region (from Jhelum to Attock). Later,
            Said Khan gifted this place to his daughter who was married to
            Mughal emperor Jahangir son of Mughal emperor Akbar.<br />

            Saidpur is a worth visiting and historically fascinating place in
            Islamabad holding the culture and history of Hindus, Muslims and
            Sikhs all together at a time. Jahangir’s biography, Tuzk-e-Jahangiri
            mentioned him staying in Saidpur while he was on his way to
            Kabul.<br />

            The village used to be a garden resort at that time. Talking to this
            agency, Mohammad Saad, a visitor at the place said, “It was not the
            taste of food or name of the restaurants that attracted me.” “It was
            rather the aroma and cultural history of the village that fascinated
            me,” he added. A Hindu commander Raja Man Singh later converted
            Saidpur into a place of Hindu worship. He constructed small ponds
            and temples for the worship of Hindus. Those temples have been
            preserved to show the history and culture of Hindu in the region.
            Alongside the temple, a Gurdwara was also built by the Sikhs,
            probably in the 20th century. Attached to the gurdwara is a
            big-sized room, which served as a school for teaching the philosophy
            of Guru Nanak.
